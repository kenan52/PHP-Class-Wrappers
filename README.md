# PHP-Class-Wrappers
In this repository you can find some PHP Classes which are the wrappers for the various functions.
This can be very useful if you want to get these things:
<br>
a) Autoload of the Classes only when you need them (so you only need to require autoloader once)
<br>
b) No need for creating one-time file with functions (you know exactly where to find your function/methods)
<br>
c) Categorised Class and their functions/methods (Security, Settings, Connection, Database, etc. means easier use)
<br>
d) Static methods so you don't need to instantiate object every time you need method
<br>
e) Working mailer (so you don't need to use default mailer which is not so good in PHP, and here you have many many options)
<br>
f) Working templater (so you can save the html template with your variables in the form of the {{variable}}, and then include the template and interpolate variables to their data only when you need it - no need to overuse require/include)
<br>
g) Working database connection in the singleton class, and ready-made database methods for getting, setting, updating and deleting the data)
<br>
h) Well documented code and process
<br>
i) Test for every class and its methods on its bottom
