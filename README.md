# PHP-Class-Wrappers
In this repository you can find some PHP Classes which are the wrappers for the various functions.
This can be very useful if you want to get these things:
a) Autoload of the Classes only when you need them (so you only need to require autoloader once)
b) No need for creating one-time file with functions (you know exactly where to find your function)
c) Categorised Class and their functions (Security, Settings, Connection, Database, etc. means easier use)
d) Static functions so you don't need to instantiate object every time you need function
e) Working mailer (so you don't need to use default mailer which is not so good in PHP, and here you have many many options)
f) Working templater (so you can save the html template with your variables in the form of the {{variable}}, and then include the template and interpolate variables to their data only when you need it - no need to overuse require/include)
g) Working database connection in the singleton class, and ready-made database methods for getting, setting, updating and deleting the data)
h) Well documented code and process
i) Test for every class on its bottom
